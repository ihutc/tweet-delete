    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/ihutc" target="_blank">My Twitter profile</a> is a graveyard of half-baked opinion and poor cultural taste from my formative years. The presence of these tweets going in my &ldquo;adult&rdquo; life has soured my relationship with social media.</p>
    <p>For some, content like this has impacted people's lives well after it's written. Thankfully, tools exist that unceremoniously delete old tweets in bulk.</p>
    <p>This website presents my old tweets one last time. You're invited to press backspace, removing a character from a tweet. Keep pressing until the tweet is permanently deleted from my profile.</p>
